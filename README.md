# HarmonicMotion

To-Do List:


Add a Particle System to the cube like in the original app

Make sure empty objects are centered (reset transform)

Create some more Materials with different colors

Go through the UI elements and make sure the Text components are middle center aligned, vertical and horizontal overflow

Find a nice free-to-use font for the UI

Check all line renderers, optimise (no shadows etc.)

Set up the main menu with buttons for scenes, help, quit

Set up zoom and pan controls

Use the back button on the phone?

Make the UI nice and more equally spaced

The graphs/diagrams might look better with visible tracers (quad/sphere child)

Give the trail renderers different colors

Start hunting for bugs

Set up markers for the parallel oscillations

Eventually expand parallel oscillations for more input, use a scroll view and add +/- buttons

Make the toggles larger and easier to tap

Figure out how to render a 3D trail (drop stationary particles behind the cube?)
