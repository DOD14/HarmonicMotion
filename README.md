# HarmonicMotion

To-Do List:

Make sure empty objects are centered (reset transform)

Go through the UI elements and make sure the Text components are middle center aligned, vertical and horizontal overflow

Check all line renderers, optimise (no shadows etc.)

The graphs/diagrams might look better with visible tracers (quad/sphere child)
